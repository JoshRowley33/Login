This project is a login and registration system built in HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 
It allows users to register with a username and password, which is stored in the browser's local storage
for persistance. 
the login system verifies credentials against stored user data and grants access if they match. 

key features include a password strength meter that visually indicates security levels bases on password complexity,
real time validation to prevent duplicate username and an interactive UI that enables smooth tab switching between login
and registration forms. 
Upon successful login, users are automatically redirected to the PNP rota webpage. simulating the transition to a protected area 

the file structure consits of index.html as the main interface, future enhancements may include secure passowrd
hashing to prevent plain-text storage, backend integration for centralized authentication, and email verification
with password recovery system.
